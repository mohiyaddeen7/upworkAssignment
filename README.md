# Redirection Page

This simple HTML file with Javascript logic creates a redirection page that automatically redirects users to a specified URL after the page loads.

## Purpose
The purpose of this HTML file is to provide a basic redirection mechanism using JavaScript. When a user accesses this page, they will see a message indicating redirection and will be automatically redirected to a designated URL.

## Usage
1. **Customizing Redirection**:
    - To change the URL to which users are redirected, modify the `destination_url` variable in the script section of the HTML file. Replace `'https://www.javatpoint.com/java-stringjoiner'` with the desired URL.

2. **Implementation**:
    - Save this HTML code into a file with a `.html` extension.
    - Upload the file to a web server or host it on GitHub Pages.

3. **Use case**: After hosting on GitHub Pages, a link will be generated that you can add to an Instagram account under the bio. Whenever someone clicks on the link, it will not show the typical 'You're leaving our app' warning popup.

## Important Note
- Ensure proper authorization and permission before redirecting users to external URLs.
- Consider informing users about the redirection in advance for a better user experience.
